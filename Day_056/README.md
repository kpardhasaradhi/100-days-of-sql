Unique City Routes Query

Problem
You are given a table city_distance that stores distances between pairs of cities. Each record includes:

source — the starting city
destination — the ending city
distance — the distance between them
Some routes appear twice in reverse order (for example, New Delhi–Panipat and Panipat–New Delhi). The task is to remove such duplicates and keep only one record for each unique route.

Goal
Return a list of unique city pairs with their corresponding distances, ensuring that each route appears only once regardless of direction.

Approach
Create a CTE (cte) to normalize city pairs by defining city1 and city2 such that the alphabetically smaller city always comes first.
Use a second CTE (cte2) to count occurrences of each unique pair using a window function with PARTITION BY city1, city2, distance.
Select only one record per unique route by filtering where the count is 1 or where source < destination.
Query
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT distance, source, destination,
           CASE WHEN source < destination THEN source ELSE destination END AS city1,
           CASE WHEN source < destination THEN destination ELSE source END AS city2
    FROM city_distance
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT distance, source, destination,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY city1, city2, distance) AS cnt
    FROM cte
)
SELECT distance, source, destination
FROM cte2
WHERE cnt = 1 OR source < destination;
Output
distance	source	destination
100	New Delhi	Panipat
200	Ambala	New Delhi
1500	Bangalore	Mysore
2500	Mumbai	Pune
2500	Chennai	Bhopal
Explanation
The first CTE ensures consistent ordering of city names for comparison.
The second CTE counts how many times each unique pair appears.
The final query filters out duplicates by keeping only one direction for each route.
